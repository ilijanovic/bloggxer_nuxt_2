# The 5 best exercises for a massive and defined back

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>

**Having a slim statue and upper arms like the Hulk is certainly appealing, but if you're running like Goofy while doing it, something went wrong: probably training your back. For both men and women, little is more enchanting than a beautiful back, because a well-trained back not only looks very appealing, it also shows self-discipline and know-how. The reason: the back is somehow always trained, but not everyone can train it in isolation and thus achieve the desired result. After all, there are a few things to consider, from the trapezius muscle to the latissimus and the back extensor.**

## Why should the back be trained?

In addition to posture and the attractive V-shape of the upper body, there are other good reasons to train your back. One of these reasons is a preventive measure. If your back has to carry a lot to a lot of weight (which incidentally also includes muscles), your back will eventually suffer. The result is back pain. The same happens when you don't exercise and spend too much time sitting. If you already have back pain, you should not start with back training straight away. Rather, consult your doctor to find out the cause and then start doing back exercises according to your doctor's instructions. Once you've got your back back in order, back training will be an excellent relief in everyday life, whether it's just carrying your groceries or doing other sporting activities.

### "Do I have to do something or is that possible?"

But how are you supposed to know whether your back is sufficiently trained or not? You can find out with a very simple test and all you need is yourself, a watch and a chair that you can sit on with your legs at a 45 degree angle. Sit in this chair, cross your arms over your chest and put your hands on your shoulders. Now stand up as fast as you can five times in a row, noting the total time it takes you to do this. The result provides information about whether you should train your back. If the measured or observed time is more than 10 seconds, this is a clear case of: You should definitely train. If you are well above that, it is even more than alarming and a case for your doctor, because that allows conclusions to be drawn about a defective sense of balance and thus your risk of falling. And what is your result? If you're just over 10 seconds, now is the time for the best exercises for a toned and massive back.

## The best back exercises

If you're wondering why the following exercises don't just hit your muscles, rest assured: everything is fine. Targeted back muscle training requires not only the individual muscle groups, but also coordination and flexibility.

### Exercise 1: Ball bounce (beginners)

Exercise 1 is particularly suitable for beginners and should be done together with other back exercises every day for at least 5 minutes. A few seconds break between sessions are allowed. When bouncing a ball, stand hip-width apart, lift a ball (the size of a soccer ball) over your head so that you can just see it, straighten your spine and smash the ball onto the ground in front of you with all your might. You bend your upper body forward without bending your spine. You should also catch the ball with a stretched spine.

### Exercise 2: Extended Squat (Beginner)

For exercise 2 you need an object that weighs about 1 kg. This can be a dumbbell or a filled water bottle. To do this, stand with one leg straight on a balance pad and lift the other leg so that your thighs and lower legs form a 45-degree angle. From this position you now do the well-known squats by bending your standing leg by a maximum of 90 degrees with a straight upper body. It's like you're pretending to skate. After at least 15 repetitions, switch legs and repeat the exercise. Do them for at least 5 minutes as well.

### Exercise 3: Deadlift (Advanced)

Exercise 3 is useful for shopping or carrying shopping bags. For this, stand shoulder-width in front of a barbell on the floor. Keeping your back straight, tighten your abs, and bend your knees as you bend down toward the barbell. Now grip the dumbbell in such a way that the weights are evenly distributed on both your arms and lift the barbell out of your straight legs. You maintain body tension throughout the exercise. With your eyes fixed on a fixed point, hold the barbell for a few seconds as soon as you are in an upright position. For the best possible strain on the back muscles, pull your shoulder blades together slightly. Now lower the barbell while maintaining body tension. Make sure to use all of the aforementioned muscles evenly so that you don't lift from your back alone. You want your back to be stressed, but you don't want it to do all the work on its own to prevent back injuries. Repeat this exercise as often as you can.

### Exercise 4: Dumbbell Rows (Advanced)

Exercise 4 is very good for training the latissimus and thus for a broader back, which you should also do as often as you can. Ideally, it is performed with a flat bench, but since not everyone has one at home, we present you a modification with the same effect. Sit in a chair with a dumbbell. Upper and lower legs form a 45 degree angle, a dumbbell lies in front of you on the floor. With your back straight and your upper body tight, bend down and grab the barbell, keeping your back straight halfway between sitting up straight and the lowest point you grabbed the barbell. From here, with the weight in your hand, pull your arm back and forward at an angle. Your bent arm is at shoulder height, a maximum stretch should be achieved. Repeat this exercise at least 15 times with each arm. If you don't feel full enough, increase the weight of the dumbbell. A good starting weight for beginners is 5 kg, for advanced 10 kg.


### Exercise 5: Chest to Bar Chin-Ups (Pros)

Exercise 5 is definitely only for those who can do all the other exercises regularly and without problems, because it already requires a good amount of muscle strength in the back. You will need a pull-up bar for this exercise. You can buy it for little money and you shouldn't be without it if you want to master the supreme discipline of back exercises. It is simple to carry out: you grab the pull-up bar and pull yourself up with your arm and back muscles alone until your chest touches the pull-up bar. Repeat this exercise about 6-8 times. If you can't do a pull-up yet, you can do the exercise in a weaker form by placing a stool under the pull-up bar and using your leg muscles to pull yourself up. Make sure you stand securely so that the stool cannot slip away from under your foot. Exercise 5 uses every imaginable back muscle and its correct execution is the goal of many athletes.

As you can see, you can train your back muscles with many small exercises. As is so often the case, no blanket statements can be made about how regularly and how often you should do the individual exercises, because that depends heavily on how advanced you are in your training. It is best to train in such a way that you feel a physical strain. Sore muscles the next day is always a good indicator.
