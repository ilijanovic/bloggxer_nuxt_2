## The 5 tips for distance diving

Covering long distances in depth diving will also give you the opportunity to dive much deeper than usual in the sea.

A rough formula for this: Your diving distance minus 22 divided by 2 or (diving distance in meters – 22)/2 = diving depth

So if you can cover a distance of 50 meters, you would theoretically be able to dive about 14 meters deep.

One thing that comes naturally to deep ocean diving is pressure equalization, which is a must for you to learn.

### 1. Don't always look ahead

Imagine you are diving your last length of distance diving, your breathing stimulus is already relatively uncomfortable. You look in vain for the end of the track by always looking ahead. It still looks infinitely far away, causing you to abandon the attempt and surface.

You surface, take a breath, and actually you could have dived much further. You're a little angry inside.

Are you familiar with that?

Due to the optical distortion under water, the next turn or the saving edge of the pool appears incredibly far away, which causes you to become disillusioned, since you are already mentally struggling with the stimulus to breathe.

So always keep your head straight by simply tracing and observing the black line on the ground below.

About 1-1.5 meters before the end of the track, the horizontal black bar will already point you to the end of the track.

Just try to concentrate on the essentials beforehand:

- The right technique
- To your relaxation

### 2. Pay attention to streamlining


To maximize your dive distance, also try to be streamlined.

What does that actually mean?

Your body should form a straight line in the water.

- To do this, keep your arms and hands straight and stretched forward, over your head so that you can glide through the water like an arrow. This would be the most optimal case for the best streamlining and lowest drag in the water.
- Or you look that your arms are relaxed on the left and right of your body in the direction of your thighs and are relatively close to your body. This is the more relaxed option

Test what you like best. That is absolutely a matter of taste. The dolphin technique is not for everyone.

It's a bit more exhausting as it requires active effort and energy to fix yourself in this position and it requires quite a bit of stretching as the ligaments and tendons need to be stretched quite a bit.

### 3. Be properly balanced

Probably the most important tip that usually creates the greatest potential for further distances in depth diving.

Proper buoyancy is so incredibly important!

What actually is taring? The buoyancy indicates whether adding lead counteracts the buoyancy or, conversely, reducing the lead weights to set a certain downforce.

#### What is perfect buoyancy now?

Perfect buoyancy is when you have no buoyancy or downforce at the depth you want to maintain throughout the dive.

You are then neutrally balanced and do not have to expend any energy or force to get back into your neutral position.

***Case #1 Too Much Weight:*** You are below neutral buoyancy and have to fight downforce all the time. In this case, you push your body through the water like a truck, which will cost you several wasted meters afterwards.

***Case #2 Low Weight:*** You are low on weight, above your perfect and neutral buoyancy. You're bobbing around on the surface and your streamlining suffers extremely.

#### How do I find out if I'm carrying too little or maybe too much lead?

Luckily it's not that difficult.

You just have to make sure that you always breathe in the exact same amount of air that you always take with you for your depth diving dive.

How to do it:

- Breathe in the maximum amount of air.
- Push yourself off the edge of the pool and glide to the height you normally take for your dive.
- Glide until you come to a stop, you may be able to do 1-2 fin kicks to let yourself glide again.
- If you have buoyancy, you need a little more lead.
- But if you have downforce, you have to reduce some lead.

You repeat this for so long and so often until you are really perfectly balanced. And it can even come down to a measly 100 grams. You won't believe how much that can mean.

To perfect it even further I would recommend using a neck lead. This allows you to adjust the neutral buoyancy really precisely to you and tickle out a few more meters.

### 4. The correct diving speed for distance diving

Yes, everyone has to reappear at some point. Even if we prefer to stay under water for an infinitely long time when snorkeling / freediving. It's no use. We need the oxygen and unfortunately we don't have gills to filter the oxygen out of the water.

#### Case #1 Too slow

If you are traveling too slowly... let's say just under 0.5 m/s (meters per second), you would need an incredible 100 seconds for a distance of 50 meters according to Adam Riese.

But if you finally want to reach your 100 meters in distance diving at the same speed, you would need a whole 200 seconds or 3 minutes and 20 seconds......and that while moving!

That's going to be pretty difficult.

But if you can hold your breath for almost 7 minutes, you could do just as well to get to 100 meters.

Otherwise, I would recommend stepping on the accelerator a little bit.

You have to get faster, otherwise long distances won't work.

#### Case #2 Too fast

Now the opposite case.

Your dive speed is way too high. Let's just assume 3 m/s (meters per second).

You can do the 50 meters in 16.67 seconds. That's really impressive! That should be almost Olympic values.

But you won't be able to keep up this high speed for long, because the flow resistance that counteracts you in the water increases the faster you move through the water.

The lactate formation rate is so high with this effort that your muscles acidify and cramp too quickly until no further movements are possible.

You absolutely have to slow down!

With special apnea fins you can really influence and control your speed.

Your fin stroke doesn't have to be so fast and powerful, as the apnea fins are incredibly efficient.

#### The perfect speed

Now you know why you don't reach your route if you're going too slow or too fast.

What is actually the optimal speed that you should aim for when diving long distances?

Since you are limited in time if you are going too slowly, and also physically, by exerting too much effort against the water resistance, you have to achieve the most efficient and most economical speed possible.

The most optimal speed for distance diving is about 1 m/s (meters per second).

So you would need exactly 100 seconds for 100 meters.

That sounds different than 300 seconds and it should be doable, right?

It's definitely the best cost/benefit factor, from the time you're underwater to the effort required to reach that distance.

### 5. Wear a suit that is as thin as possible for distance diving

How much weight do you carry around when you do your depth diving exercises? 6…7…8 kg or even significantly more?

If you wear your thick suit, which is actually intended for outside, in the indoor pool, you have to compensate for the buoyancy that this suit causes with lead.

Your lead also wants to be dragged through the water and it also causes turbulence and increases your water resistance.

All negative effects.

So try to make your apnea suit as thin as possible.

So you need less lead and glide much better through the water.
