# Cardio training: 10 tips on how to train effectively in the studio

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>

**Cardio training has a positive effect on your heart, circulation and vitality, and it also increases your basic endurance.**

**The range of training options is huge in most gyms.**

**But on which device do you train most effectively? Which program do you choose and at what intensity do you burn the most calories?**

## 1. Which cardio machine should I train on?

In general, you burn most of the calories on the treadmill.

According to a study by the Cologne Sports University, the cross trainer has the best ratio of perceived exertion and energy consumption. The bicycle ergometer, on the other hand, is perceived as particularly strenuous.

How effective your cardio training really is ultimately depends heavily on the intensity with which you train.

Beginners or physically handicapped athletes should start their cardio workout on the joint-gentle cross trainer or recumbent bike. Alternatively, walk on the treadmill.

**In the table you can see the consumption by cardio device:**

| device type              | total energy consumption | Total fat consumption |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| treadmill                | 810 kcal/h               | 60 - 63 g/h           |
| cross trainer            | 800 kcal/h               | 56 - 60 g/h           |
| stepper                  | 800 kcal/h               | 56 - 60 g/h           |
| rowing machine           | 800 kcal/h               | 53 - 60 g/h           | 
| bicycle ergometer        | 780 kcal/h               | 51 - 55 g/h           |
| Recumbent bike ergometer | 750 kcal/h               | 49 - 53 g/h           |

## 2. Do I have to measure my pulse during cardio training?

Your cardio training is most effective if you control the intensity via heart rate.

Most gym equipment has sensors that need to be wrapped to measure heart rate, some receive signals from chest straps (more reliable readings!) or paired smartwatches.

You can enter your age on the display, from which a recommendation for the optimal training pulse is calculated according to your maximum heart rate (rough formula: 220 minus age). After that comes the resistance.

Important: In order for the programs to be able to give you the right specifications, the pulse measurement must be guaranteed during the entire cardio workout!

## 3. Which cardio program should I choose?

The most common cardio programs to choose from are "Fat Burn" and "Interval or Hill Training."

The "fat burning" mode is a bit misleading. At the low intensity specified here (approx. 65 percent of the maximum heart rate), the fat metabolism is activated, but you burn more calories with interval or hill training.

It is best for beginners to train in fat burning mode for the first two to three months. Then you can replace one unit per week with interval training.

## 4. What intensity do I set?

With any cardio machine, you can set the intensity manually. It depends on your training level and goal.

### 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (HR max)

At this intensity you activate your fat metabolism. In percentage terms, this is where you burn the most fat.

### 70 to 80 percent of HR max

Here you train in the aerobic area. You increase your basic endurance and become more efficient in the long term.

Recommendation for beginners: Train in these two areas for the first two to three months and only increase the distance or training duration.

### 80 to 90 percent of HR max

Advanced users switch to a higher intensity every second training session - by increasing the speed or intervals such as sprints.

This is where your body burns the most energy from carbohydrates and fats. You get into a calorie deficit, which helps you lose weight.

## 5. What shoes do I wear on the treadmill?

Treadmills are excellently cushioned, but you should still do without sneakers and wear sensible running shoes in the studio (if you buy them, you should definitely seek detailed and professional advice!).

The heavier you are, the more important cushioned shoes are, since your own weight is constantly on your feet. For better power transmission on the ergometer, the sole should be as stiff as possible

## 6. How much oxygen do I need during training?

Air regulation during an indoor cardio workout is a tricky subject: in the studio you have to rely on the large air conditioning system. And if you open the windows at home, you risk catching a cold.

Basically, avoid drafts and still make sure you have enough oxygen to protect your circulation. In the studio, it is always advisable to train when there is not a large crowd.

## 7. How much should I drink during cardio training?

Golden rule: Drink at least 500 ml of liquid during 45 minutes of cardio training - in small sips! You usually sweat a little more indoors than when doing endurance sports outside because there is no cool breeze, let alone a headwind.

It's best to drink still water - you can pimp it with some lemon or cucumber and a pinch of salt.

## 8. What is the correct posture on the cardio machines?


The following applies to all cardio machines: do not make any lateral movements! In the ideal case, the arms, legs and trunk only move in the longitudinal plane, the knee joints "stand" over the feet and not to the side.

- Stay upright on the treadmill, don't cramp up and don't put your feet too far forward, but rather under your body.
- It is best to have the bicycle ergometer adjusted by a trainer for your first cardio workout, because the ergonomically correct sitting position depends on many factors. Above all, your legs should not be stretched out in the lowest stepping position, but they should not be bent too much either.
- Stay upright and relaxed on the cross trainer, heels on the ground, arms actively involved, and hands gripping the levers. Running backwards requires a very good sense of movement and is not for beginners in cardio training.

By the way: Reading usually leads to a tense posture! Focus on your workout and listen to music...

## 9. Which music goes well with cardio training?

Listening to music makes training easier - it's even been scientifically proven. It is best to put together your own individual playlists or use one from Spotify. It helps if the beat matches your cardio workout.

The following applies: up to 120 beats per minute (BPM) for lower intensity or warm-up and cool-down. Above 120 BPM if you really want to accelerate.

## 10. How do I design warm-up and cool-down?

Because you don't do any explosive movements such as jumps during cardio training on the equipment, you can save yourself an extensive warm-up. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity after about five minutes.

Important: If you combine strength training and cardio workouts, then you should start with strength training!

The following applies to the cool-down: run or bike for about five minutes! Afterwards you can stretch.

Pay attention to your body's signals and give it enough time to regenerate after training!
