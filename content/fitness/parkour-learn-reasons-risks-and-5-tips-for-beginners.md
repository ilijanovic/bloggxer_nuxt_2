# Learning parkour, reasons, risks and 5 tips for beginners

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>

**Parkour is an exciting trend sport that you can do almost anywhere. It looks very impressive how experienced parkour runners run over obstacles, jump and combine the movements smoothly. But how do you learn these combinations? We explain how you learn Parkour and what you have to consider.**

## What parkour is

Parkour ("Le Parkour") refers to running and jumping over obstacles. Movements are combined in order to get from A to B as efficiently and effortlessly as possible. Mostly these obstacle courses take place in the city over railings, stairs, walls and houses. Meanwhile there are also parkour halls for sports. Aids are not used, the whole thing works exclusively with the power of your own body. "Parkour runners" are called "traceurs".

Parkour is considered by many people not only as a sport but also as an art. There is something dancelike and graceful about the flowing movements of the traceurs, the control of the movements and the balance of the runners is impressive. However, many years of training are often behind it.

Parkour is often confused with freerunning. The sports are similar, but the designs are different. While you should reach your goal with as efficient movements as possible in parkour, freerunning is all about creative jumps and tricks, such as somersaults.

## Why you should try Parkour

Even though professional tracers see their sport as an art, it's still a sport. In parkour you are constantly in motion with your whole body and strain your muscles. Accordingly, it is a full body workout where a traceur burns up to over 800 calories per hour. Parkour can therefore help with fat burning and with healthy and fast weight loss, but beginners do easier distances and burn less accordingly.

Parkour not only trains the body, but also the mind. Traceurs require a high level of concentration, good self-assessment and a lot of self-discipline. These are qualities that you all train automatically in parkour. You will also learn to better assess your limits.

Parkour also helps to reduce stress. As you climb, jump and run over obstacles, your entire focus is on your movements and estimating the distance to the next obstacle. You will quickly forget the stress of everyday life. Other advantages are the individual and minimalist aspects of the sport. Although there are general movements that you should know, you can also develop your own. Everyone moves at a different pace and in different ways, so each traceur develops their own style. In addition, you hardly need any equipment for the sport. Comfortable clothing in which you can move easily and decent sports shoes with a good grip are sufficient.

## Risks of sport

While parkour is a very artistic sport, it also involves some risk. Especially if you complete your obstacle courses in the city - over railings, walls and walls. There is no protection and one misstep can mean an injury. Many people have a bad impression of the sport because they see professional tracers in action and cannot believe the risks these people are taking. This impression keeps many from giving the sport a chance. You can determine the difficulty and the corresponding risk yourself.

In general, parkour is only as difficult as you make it. If you don't want to expose yourself to a high risk, you can just leave it. There are now many parkour halls where you can practice the sport extensively and train certain movements before trying them out without protection. Because in halls, the obstacles are usually underlaid with safe mats, so that the risk of injury is drastically reduced.

In addition, there is no competition in parkour. There is no time pressure and nobody is your opponent. Everyone does routes that match their level of experience. You choose your movements carefully before they eventually become completely automatic. As you get better at parkour, the risk of injury decreases as your control and balance improve. Good shoes can also reduce the risk. A good sole with lots of grip and good cushioning protects your feet from injuries.

## This is the best way to learn Parkour

It's always best to learn a sport from someone who already knows it. All major cities have parkour groups that you can join. These clubs teach newcomers to parkour and show you the basics. You will get a small introduction to the typical movement sequences such as shoulder rolls, precision jumps and the correct landing. You can also get to know good places for parkour running through a group or club.

You can often find such groups in parkour halls. These offer the best entry point for beginners as they take the inhibition out of trying different tricks thanks to the added security. This way you can practice the movements and learn what it means to move efficiently over obstacles. You can also find parkour coaches there who can teach you. You can also teach yourself the basics on your own. You can actually practice techniques like the precision jump or the shoulder roll anywhere, for example on a lawn.

## 5 tips for parkour beginners

Parkour is not an easy sport. It takes a lot of training to make the movement sequences as fluid as possible and to combine them. To help you get started, we have five tips for you.

### 1. Don't overestimate yourself

Don't underestimate the risks of parkour. Especially when you are out and about in the city, you should always stay focused and not overestimate yourself. If you're a beginner, don't try to imitate the pros. The more experienced the traceur, the better he can estimate the distance, height and danger. He also knows exactly what his own abilities are. These are very important qualities that you must learn over time.

As a beginner, you should practice with easy obstacles where the risk of injury is not as high. Parkour halls are perfect for this, or obstacles on grass or sand.

### 2. Start slow

If you dare too much too fast in parkour, you will only hurt yourself. So start small and work your way up. Set your own goals and don't focus on others. Parkour halls mostly offer obstacles with different levels of difficulty. If you want to try certain moves and tricks, always try them indoors first. If you master them well, you can also use them in the city. Parkour is not a safe sport, that's why experience is so important. You should always have respect for the obstacles and risks and not be too reckless.

### 3. Join a group

In almost all big cities like Berlin, Hamburg or Cologne you can now find parkour clubs or groups. This is the best way to learn the sport. You will also get to know like-minded people and traceurs who have already gained a lot of experience. Sport is much more fun with other people and you motivate each other.

Learning the sport with others is also better because you always have each other's eyes on each other. So if something happens, someone will be there right away. In addition, the other traceurs can help you with the right technique if you have any questions. But remember that everyone should run at their own pace. Don't feel compelled to tackle certain obstacles without really being prepared for them.

### 4. Train your body

Parkour is a very strenuous sport. Your whole body is challenged. Even if you train your fitness with parkour, it is not a bad idea to prepare your body for the sport at the same time. For example, in parkour you need a lot of stamina. You can train this well with running exercises such as jogging.

You can also train your muscles, as you probably often pull yourself up on walls or similar obstacles in parkour. Good muscles also increase the stability of the body. Since you are always lifting your own body weight in parkour, training with your own body weight, such as push-ups, is a good idea. When training the muscles, you should make sure that you don't build them up so much that they limit your movements. You can find out more about the right diet for muscle building here.

The sense of balance is also important. You have to balance over certain passages. That's why you should train your balance a little on tree trunks or poles.

Because your body is so challenged and under tension in parkour, relaxing exercises such as yoga are a good way to balance it out

## 5. Always warm up

In parkour, the muscles work quickly and heavily. That's why you should always prepare them for the load beforehand. So warm up extensively. A good warm-up session can also prevent sore muscles.

With a good warm-up training, the physical willingness to perform as well as the mental readiness will be increased. Warming up also reduces the risk of injury. Muscles, ligaments, joints and the cardiovascular system are stimulated and prepared for the actual activity.

## Similar sports

Parkour is often confused with similar sports. For example, many people think parkour and freerunning are the same sport. The aim of parkour is to reach the goal as quickly as possible and with as little effort as possible. Freerunning is more about performing tricks and artistic moves.

## Free running

Freerunning and parkour are often confused with each other because some of the movements and techniques of the two disciplines and the areas of application of the two sports are similar.

In freerunning, however, the focus is primarily on creativity, not speed or efficiency as in parkour. That's why freerunners combine jumps over obstacles with tricks like somersaults. Because of the spectacular nature of the sport, it has spread widely, especially through the media.

## Tricking

Tricking is a young sport that is more like freerunning than parkour. Tricking is a mixture of different martial arts techniques, in which you mainly do tricks like somersaults, twists and turns in the air. This works completely without tools and with the power of your own body. It's like freerunning without the obstacles.

## Obstacle Course and Extreme Obstacle Course

The classic steeplechase is a discipline in athletics in which the athlete runs a given distance as fast as possible while jumping over obstacles. Over time, however, this sport has also developed and many are now training for extreme obstacle courses. Similar to parkour, this trend sport also comes from the military. It's about overcoming very difficult obstacles such as jungle gyms, crawling tracks, diving tracks or tire barricades. Among other things, your endurance, dexterity and coordination are promoted.
