# Muscle building – this is how you reach your goal faster

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>

**Want to build muscle fast? Then you have to feed yourself properly and qualify properly. In this post, we show you 5 tips to help you reach your goal.** 

**Fast muscle building is possible, but requires discipline in terms of training and nutrition and - for better or for worse - a bit of patience. You can expect the first results after about 6 weeks. Once you've made a start, you'll quickly see further successes when building muscle, which is something to be proud of. The be-all and end-all for fast muscle building is a plan and the right diet. In our Muscle Pack, you get it all together.**



This is how you build muscle fast

- Eat enough protein
- Cover your calorie needs
- Train with weight
- Go to your limits
- Give yourself breaks

## Fast muscle building - 5 tips for your success

### 1. Eat enough protein



For fast muscle building, you should consume about **1.7 g of protein per kg of body weight per day**. Proteins are the building blocks of your muscles. They are made up of different amino acids. To put it simply, amino acids are the building blocks from which your body builds proteins. Any food that contains protein contains different amino acids. **Fast muscle building is simply not possible without sufficient protein.**

***Which products are useful for fast muscle building?***

It is therefore best to combine different protein-rich foods and also to integrate plant-based protein sources. This is how you supply your body with all the amino acids. Protein shakes are the ideal supplement to cover your daily protein needs.

Meat and dairy products are high in protein. It is important to buy products from responsible animal husbandry. Antibiotics and drug residues in chicken are just as unhealthy as highly processed sausages. Milk from cows that regularly graze on pastures contains better fats than milk from cows that spend their whole lives indoors and only eat concentrates.

### 2. Cover your calorie needs

Fast muscle building works best when your body is getting the amount of energy it needs. He gets it from food. You have a certain **calorie requirement** per day. This is made up of your basal metabolic rate and the performance turnover. The basal metabolic rate includes all the calories your body uses to keep your breathing, heartbeat, etc. working and to keep you awake. You also burn these calories just sitting on the couch.

With the performance turnover, the calories are added that you also consume during activities - for example at work or sports. The power consumption can therefore vary from day to day. **In order for muscle to build up faster, you should be between 300 and 500 kcal above your calorie requirement every day.** This is called a calorie surplus.

### 3. Train with weight

The fastest progress in building muscle is achieved with strength **training with weights**. Of course, you can also build muscle with bodyweight training. With weights it goes faster – especially at the beginning.

The background is that weights offer you the opportunity to optimally **adjust your training weight to your body and your individual muscle building goals.** Especially strong, large muscle groups such as legs already require a lot of strength and skills to be visibly trained with bodyweight training. Weighted squats, on the other hand, are an effective and relatively easy exercise to build leg and glute muscles quickly.

**Fast muscle building works particularly effectively** with free weights. Your advantage: In addition to the muscles that are the focus of the respective exercise, you always train the stabilizing core muscles as well.

The only exception: You are working on muscle building for the first time and want to see results quickly. **As a beginner, exercises on machines are more effective** because they guide your movement and there is less risk of injury from improper exercise execution. As a newcomer to muscle building, it is best to be instructed by an experienced trainer.

### 4. Go to your limits

No pain, no gain. Rapid muscle building requires **intensive training**. A little bit of bicep curls and posing in front of the mirror doesn't do much. Find the weight that challenges you, but doesn't overwhelm you. A clean execution should always remain in the foreground.

Guideline: You can do **8-12 repetitions 3 times**. After the last set, your muscles are so fatigued that you wouldn't be able to do another rep. As soon as it becomes easier for you, increase the weight. 3 x 12 sets are ideal for beginners looking to build muscle fast.

If you want to build muscle effectively, you should see an increase in performance over time. The keyword is progressive overload and belongs in every muscle building training. Without an increase, your body has no reason to change.

Have you been training for a long time, know your training weight and are making slow progress? Then try **pyramid training**. Here you set different stimuli within a training session. Especially when your training is stagnating and you still want to build muscle quickly, pyramid training can help you achieve your goals.

You can do pyramid training in 2 directions:

***The Ascending Pyramid:***

You start with your normal training weight and do the number of reps you normally do in a set. For example 10 squats with 30 kilos each. In the next set you increase your training weight and reduce the number of repetitions. For example, 8 reps with 70 pounds. For example, the last set would be 6 reps with 80 pounds.

***The inverted pyramid:***

Works in reverse. Sticking with the example above, your inverted pyramid would look like this: 1st set = 6 reps with 34 kg. 2nd set = 8 reps with 32 kg. 3rd set = 10 reps with 30 kg.

The inverted pyramid is only recommended if you know your training weight for sure and have mastered the exercise in question perfectly. **Always warm up properly** and do 1-2 warm-up sets with no or light weight.

### 5. Give yourself breaks

If you train too much, you risk injuries that can keep you out of action for months. And: your success. Just because you don't have sore muscles doesn't mean your muscles have fully recovered. On the non-training days, the so-called **super-compensation effect** takes place in the muscle.

Think of it this way: Your training challenged the muscle - it had to work harder than usual. He remembers that. In order to be better prepared for such a challenge the next time, **the muscle builds up more substance during the recovery period by repairing and thickening the existing muscle fibers.** In short: your muscle grows.

If you train again in this phase, this process will be disrupted. That sets you back a long way. The muscle cannot go full throttle during training and regenerate at the same time. So give it time and enjoy your non-training day.

### How often should you train to build muscle fast?

It's just as **important to stick to non-training days**. Even if your muscles may already feel fit again, ligaments, cartilage, bones, intervertebral discs and joints often take longer to adapt to the new strain. During this phase, it's important to provide your muscles with adequate protein and nutrients such as zinc and magnesium, which support normal muscle function.

***Rules of thumb for regeneration are:***

- Wait for the sore muscles to go away.
- Give your body at least a day off before engaging the same muscle group again.
- Sleep 7-8 hours a night.
- Eat a balanced, high-protein diet.
- Drink enough water and avoid alcohol. Especially on training days.

## How long does muscle building take?

How fast muscle building goes cannot be said for everyone. Age, genetic and hormonal situation also play a role, as does your initial situation and your training plan. Under normal conditions, a muscle gain of several hundred grams up to about a kilo can be achieved per month. However, due to large individual differences, the successes can also vary significantly under comparable conditions. Anyone who has already trained well will tend to build muscle again faster than someone who has never been fit and is just starting out. However, there are also beginners who can quickly achieve muscle building success.

You can expect the first improvements in your strength and body awareness after about 6 weeks of disciplined training and sensible nutrition. Clearly visible results after approx. 12 weeks.

However, fast muscle building does not mean that you automatically have a defined six-pack. Belly fat doesn't go away just because you build muscle. The right diet plays a crucial role here. Once the muscles are in place, you can start working on belly fat.

## Exercises for fast muscle building

Even if your primary goal is to build muscle quickly to look good on summer vacation, it's important that you train your whole body. This way you avoid injuries, look good and get fit all over.

Basic exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench and shoulder press should be an integral part of your muscle building training. In addition, it makes sense to integrate functional exercises. With them you build muscles quickly and at the same time optimize the interaction of your muscle groups. This is healthy and ensures a smooth movement. In short: Your movement looks better during training.

Do you already have a certain level of fitness? Then it can occasionally make sense to also integrate isolation exercises into your muscle building training. They allow you to work specifically on individual muscles and set a specific stimulus.
