# Free running, What is that?

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>

**As the name suggests, free running is all about one thing: free movement through the environment. The way from A to B is mastered creatively. Free runners focus on free artistic movement. Obstacles presented by urban and urban environments are overcome with acrobatic elements - physical, fast and prescient.**

**There are no limits to creativity in freerunning. Various techniques and tricks such as jumps, flips or somersaults are used in a free run to overcome obstacles such as gates, stairs, roofs, buildings, bridges and walls, even in the great outdoors. The movements are reminiscent of gymnastics, acrobatics and stunts. But the technical basics of free running are in the predecessor sport parkour. One of the best-known free runners is certainly the Austrian professional Alex Schauer, who is at the start worldwide with the new soles from the cooperation between Continental and adidas.**



## Parkour started in the 80's

Parkour was first mentioned in the 1980s. "Le Parkour" was founded by David Belle. Parkour is not a competitive sport and describes itself as a "sport art", whose athletes are called "traceur". The basic principle is the efficient movement from point A to point B, the spiritual harmony of body and mind - and in a creative way. Unlike freerunning, parkour places more emphasis on moving quickly and easily through obstacles, while freerunning is a more acrobatic movement.

### Beginning & emergence of freerunning

Freerunning was established in 2003 by Sebastien Foucan. The Frenchman was already involved in the emergence of Parkour in the 80s and is one of the most important people in exercise sports worldwide. Foucan became known primarily through his appearance in the film "Jump London" from 2003. Through the James Bond film "Casino Royal" (2006) he gained even more notoriety and especially free running. As the 007 villain Mollaka, Foucan hunts down Bond actor Daniel Craig in a scene lasting several minutes. The interest of large companies was aroused and the first international free running event took place in 2007 with the “Red Bull – Art of Motion”. Today, freerunning is brought to a broad fan community primarily through internet videos.

### Freerunning with style and safety

The footwear is crucial for this sport. The running shoes have to be firm enough and have enough grip for the different surfaces. The soles should be extremely non-slip. As a tire expert, this naturally suits us at Continental. Since our cooperation with adidas in 2007, we have equipped many athletes and also free runners with running shoes with our tire technology.

### Grip and traction

For freerunners, optimal grip not only means better performance, because especially in an extreme sport like free running, the most important thing is the best possible safety in movement. Because creativity and various techniques as well as tricks such as jumps, flips or somersaults make the sport dangerous. Traction is particularly important here.

## Effective equipment

Most freerunners usually wear white t-shirts and long jogging pants, which allow them to easily overcome any obstacle while still protecting their knees. Gloves that go over the knuckles are also an integral part of clothing. However, coordination, strength and endurance are among the most important pieces of equipment a free runner needs.
