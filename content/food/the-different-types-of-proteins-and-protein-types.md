# The different types of proteins and protein types

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>




## WHAT IS PROTEIN?

Protein, also known as protein, is the most important building material in the human body, as it forms the basis of every physical cell. Protein consists of the so-called amino acids, of which there are 20 different ones. Of these amino acids, 9 are particularly important for us humans because they are essential and cannot be produced by the body itself. The 3 most important amino acids are leucine, isoleucine and valine, also called (BCAA = Branched-Chain Amino Acids).
If you have an increased BCAA requirement due to intensive training, whether in endurance or weight training, our BCAA powder, such as the Inko BCAA powder, is perfect for this.

Most of our muscles are made up of proteins. It can only be built effectively if enough building blocks are available. A distinction is made between vegetable and animal protein. Animal products contain the largest amount of protein. For this reason, animal protein is said to be the best source when it comes to muscle building and exercise. A person who does sports or even aims to build muscle should consume 1.5-2.0 g of protein per kg of body weight per day as a guideline. Since it is not always easy to cover the daily requirement through normal nutrition, more and more people are turning to protein powder.

## WHAT TYPES OF PROTEIN ARE THERE?

**Animal protein:**

- Whey protein
- Casein
- Milk protein isolates
- egg protein (egg albumin)

**Vegetable protein:**

- Soy protein
- Rice protein
- Pea protein
- Hemp protein

Of these types, there are a variety of preparations that have a different effect depending on the training goal. The different products come in numerous flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, etc.

### WHEY PROTEIN

Whey protein is the most popular type of protein in muscle building and fitness. It is characterized by rapid digestion and a high proportion of important amino acids. It's also perfect in the morning or as a post-workout shake. Whey contains the three most important amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine, which are responsible for more effective muscle building. Furthermore, the amino acids contained offer optimal muscle protection (this means that if the supply of energy is too low, muscle mass is not broken down despite physical exertion). Whey protein is obtained from the whey that is produced during the production of cheese. It has a particularly high biological value. Whey protein, such as Multipower Whey Protein, is also often used to lose weight because it is ideal as a high-protein meal replacement. Whey is also available as an isolate, which contains less milk sugar and is therefore lactose-free. A special manufacturing process changes the charge of the protein in the isolate. This means the level of purity is higher with a whey isolate, increasing the quality.

### MILK PROTEIN ISOLATE (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE)

A milk protein isolate is recommended for people with lactose intolerance. Milk protein or whey isolate is obtained from whey by filtration (either microfiltration or ion filtration). It contains hardly any carbohydrates, almost no fats and no lactose (lactose-free). It is therefore very well tolerated and ideal for the time before the competition phase in bodybuilding or for muscle definition, since the diet is as low in fat and carbohydrates as possible to emphasize the individual muscle groups.

### MILK PROTEIN HYDROLYSATE (WHEYPROTEIN HYDROLYSATE)

What is the difference between isolate and hydrolyzate? Through an enzymatic breakdown of whey concentrate or whey isolate, this protein is pre-digested, so to speak, and thus absorbed by the organism particularly quickly without the body having to expend any energy. It can also be used during physical exertion, e.g. during competitions, to supply the body with proteins or amino acids without wasting energy on digestion. Hydrolyzate is part of the Multipower Whey Proteins and is often used in so-called amino shots, such as the Sponser Amino 12500 ampoules. In addition to our whey protein shakes and amino shot ampoules, there are also capsules with pure hydrolyzate from Inkospor.

### CASEIN

Like whey protein, casein is a milk protein, with the only difference being that the absorption process in the body takes longer. The casein molecules are larger than whey and take longer to process because they have to be broken down into smaller building blocks. Thus, a long-lasting protein intake is guaranteed. Many athletes drink a casein shake just before bed to provide the muscles with enough protein during the growth phase, which is why casein is often referred to as a night protein. Weider offers an extremely high-quality casein for the sleep phase, which is very popular with strength athletes.

### EGG PROTEIN

The egg protein (egg albumin) is suitable for athletes who do not tolerate dairy products well. The egg protein is made from the egg white and is characterized by its high biological value. Unlike whey, it is free of lactose, cholesterol and purine. Due to its bitter taste, it is rarely used alone in bodybuilding products. It is therefore often found as an ingredient in multi-component protein shakes to combine the different strengths of the protein types, such as in Multipower's Formula 80.

### MULTICOMPONENT PROTEIN

The multi-component protein is a mixture of different protein sources. The most common ingredients are whey, casein, soy and egg. A multi-component protein such as Multipower Formula 80 is therefore the perfect all-rounder, as it combines the advantages of the protein sources mentioned.

### SOY PROTEIN

Soy protein is the most common vegetable protein found in products like the Inko Active protein shake lactose-free. It is characterized by the presence of the 9 essential amino acids and thus offers good added value for the body. Since the molecular chain of the individual amino acids is short, the absorption process in the body is very short, similar to that of whey.
The manufacturing process of soybeans is complex. Many work steps are necessary to produce a soy protein product from the soy bean, which can be easily utilized by the human body.

### RICE PROTEIN

The rice protein is made from the whole grain of rice (whole grain). Germination and fermentation significantly increase the protein content in the rice grain. Rice protein is characterized by its almost complete amino acid profile. It is therefore ideal for muscle building and muscle maintenance. The content of isoleucine and valine is significantly higher than that of whey. The positive side effects are not neglected in the rice protein either. It contains tons of natural forms of vitamin E, which serves as an antioxidant (defense system).

### PEA PROTEIN

The pea protein is made from yellow split peas. It has 85% protein content and is therefore, like the other vegetable proteins, a good source of protein. The very high proportion of the amino acids arginine and lysine particularly stands out in the pea products. Arginine helps in the release of growth hormones and thus promotes muscle growth. The Weider Vegan Protein offers a high protein content based on pea protein.

### HEMP PROTEIN

Hemp protein is obtained from the seeds of the hemp plant. Hemp seeds have a 20 - 25 percent protein content. It has a very high biological value and is easy to digest. Hemp protein's amino acid profile is complete with essential and non-essential building blocks, meaning this type of protein is good for muscle building - and repair. Furthermore, hemp protein is very rich in micronutrients and contains large amounts of zinc, iron and magnesium. These three nutrients play an important role in bodily processes. The Feinstoff Green Protein contains not only hemp but also the protein sources almond and maca.

## WHAT IS THE BIOLOGICAL VALUE?

The biological value indicates how well the human body can absorb protein. The higher the value, the better the composition of the amino acids. In the case of foods with a high biological value, it is sufficient to eat a small amount in order to absorb enough protein. The whole egg is used as a reference value. It has a value of 100. Whey has the highest biological value in a natural form of all proteins with a value of 104-110 and is therefore higher than whole eggs. Since whey protein is particularly well absorbed by the body, whey protein is often taken directly after training because of its rich structure of amino acids in order to ensure fast and optimal protein intake.

### SOME TYPES OF PROTEIN AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL VALUE

|                     |           |
|---------------------|-----------|
| WHEY PROTEIN (WHEY) | 104 - 110 |
| CHICKEN EGG         | 100       |
| TUNA                | 92        |
| HEMP PROTEIN        | 87        |
| PORK                | 85        |
| SOY PROTEIN         | 84 - 86   |
| BEEF                | 80        |
| COW MILK            | 88        |
| BEANS               | 72        |
| RICE                | 66        |

## COMBINING DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROTEIN

Foods with a low biological value can be combined with others to achieve a higher biological value. For example, the combination of potato and egg results in a value of 136. Provided you consider the proportion of 36% whole egg and 64% potatoes. For this reason, protein mixtures such as multi-component proteins are particularly valuable. They reach a value of up to 140 or even higher, like the Sponser Whey Protein 94, which even reaches a value of 170 with only whey protein as a source.

## HOW TO USE PROTEIN POWDER?

Protein powder can be mixed with water or milk. It is also an excellent addition to muesli or can be used in baking. Protein Powder, as it is called in English, fits perfectly into a vanilla pudding or chocolate pudding. There are also ready-made products that are specially designed for muscle building, such as our Weider Protein Pudding.

The advantage of the powder is that it can be mixed quickly and easily in a shaker, e.g. the BlenderBotte sports mixer with a built-in shaker. So you can easily prepare a delicious shake at any time.
