# The best sources of protein

<keywords-vue :keywords="keywords"></keywords-vue>


**Food containing protein is essential for a healthy and balanced diet. Protein has a particularly good reputation as a structural and building material in our body. Eating protein-rich foods boosts metabolism, increases fat burning and prevents cravings, which in turn helps with weight management. But which foods contain the most protein power? Which protein sources (vegetable and animal) should I choose, and how can I increase the protein content through targeted food selection and use it for my healthy, balanced diet?**

## What you should know about protein

Proteins are made up of chains of small building blocks, also called amino acids. Our body cannot produce some of them itself, which is why they have to be ingested through food. The source and composition of the essential (vital) amino acids plays an important role in this context, because the quality of a protein, also known as its biological value, is determined by the amount and combination of the essential amino acids.

Important to know: The more a protein resembles body protein, the higher its biological value and the better it can be utilized and converted into endogenous protein. From the biological value, it can in turn be determined how much body protein we can form from 100 grams of the corresponding dietary protein.

## Protein is not just protein: the source is crucial!

Proteins are basically divided into animal and vegetable sources. For a balanced, healthy diet, you don't have to decide for or against animal or vegetable protein. Rather, it is about paying attention to the quality of the protein and then weighing it up.

Processed meat products such as cold cuts and sausages contain protein, but these sources are bad for our health due to their high fat content. Conversely, this does not mean that animal protein is fundamentally questionable. But on the contrary. Dairy products, eggs, poultry and fish are some of the healthiest sources of protein.

All essential amino acids are contained in both animal and plant-based foods. The clever combination of protein-rich foods can increase the biological value and get the best out of your health.

Vegetable protein has a particularly positive effect on health. Vegetable protein sources also contain many vitamins, minerals and polyunsaturated fats. Due to the large amount of roughage, secondary plant substances and carbohydrates, vegetable protein keeps you full for a particularly long time, which prevents cravings.

However, animal protein has a higher amount of essential amino acids. In order to obtain a protein with a particularly high biological value, the clever combination of animal and vegetable protein sources is recommended.

### Certain mixing ratios can significantly increase the protein value:

- Potato + egg (65:35 mixing ratio) = 136 biological value
- Meat + brown rice (55:45 mixing ratio) = 128 biological value
- Grain + milk (75:25 mixing ratio) = 125 biological value

## What should the ratio of vegetable to animal protein look like?

A mix of plant and lean animal protein sources is ideal. Even if animal protein has a higher value, it is recommended to get more than half of the protein sources from plant sources.

Why? Vegetable protein from vegetables, legumes and grains contains additional micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber and trace elements. Compared to animal protein, it therefore has a significantly lower fat and calorie content and is also cholesterol-free. All of this benefits a balanced and healthy diet.

## As a vegan, can I also cover my protein requirements through diet?

Yes. No animal protein is required for an adequate protein supply. However, if you completely avoid animal products, you should know as much as possible about the best protein sources.
